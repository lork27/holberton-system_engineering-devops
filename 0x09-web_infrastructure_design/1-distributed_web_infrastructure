I'm adding two servers to eliminate that SPOF and being able to do maintenance and updates
on my application with less or none downtime.

In this case I'm using an active-active configuration to achieve load balancing

Some issues with this configuration are the lack of security or monitoring tools.
It lacks any firewall whatsoever, it doesn't have any way of monitoring each individual server
to know when its getting overloaded and it doesn't use HTTPS
